## Disclaimer

- I'd like to remind you that even minor changes on Deepseek website can sometimes cause unexpected issues with the extension's functionality and appearance.
- Your patience are greatly appreciated. If you notice any obvious issues with the appearance or functionality of the extension, I'm likely already working on it or it has already been fixed, but the new release is not pushed yet or the Chrome Store hasn't yet reflected the changes live. You can track the status on GitHub to stay informed.
- Please note that this is a hobby project and it all depends on my available free time, so it might take a little while to get everything up and running. </br>

**Thank you for your understanding.**
